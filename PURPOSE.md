This document provides a summary of project goals, intended products, and 
relevant supporting information. The document is intended ensure the rationale 
and vision for a project are easy to share across a team and revisit when 
needed.

## Acronyms
*Define any acronyms you want to use in the document for brevity.*

POC: Partners for Our Children

## Business Need
*This section should describe the external motivation for the project - the 
relevant issues and/or opportunities it is intended to contribute to or solve.*

POC does not currently educate wombats.

## Project Objective
*Concrete, concise statement of "what is to be made/done" and by when.*

Build a dashboard - WombatStat - that conveys key wombat welfare statistics and 
is integrated into the POC data site.

Target for completion is August 1, 2019

## Project Goal
*Purpose of the thing to be made/done. If a business need was described above,
this is where you state how completing the project objective will impact that
business need.*

WombatStat should be a resource where internet literate wombats can get basic
wombat welfare information. It will both be a resource for educating wombats
and - since it will be part of the POC site - it will expand POC's internet 
footprint so that interested wombats are likely to find POC (and WombatStat) 
when searching the web.

## Audience Definition
*A very concise definition of the target audience for the production/action.
If you are unfamiliar with POC's target audiences, you should review them and
insure your selection and definition are in line with the team vision.*

This is a tool targeted towards new sections of the General Public.

## Key Tasks Product Will Support for Target Audience(s)
*Only really useful when the project is product focused. In this case, you need 
to specify the most important one to five tasks the product will support. The 
product should be designed around these tasks and product testing should test 
the target audience ability to complete these tasks. Do not try to design a 
single product for more than five tasks - more tasks than this suggests you 
either need multiple products or you need to develop and test your product in 
phases.*

Wombats should be able to:
* Learn about the wombat welfare process - where it begins and keys stages
participants proceed through.
* Get a rough sense of how many wombats are involved at different stages
of the wombat welfare process.
* Determine how many wombats are currently in out-of-hole care.
* Determine common outcomes for out-of-hole care.
* Assess how out-of-hole placement and outcomes have changed over time 
(current should allow for coverage of the last 12 years).

## Deliverables
*List of the concrete components that satisfy the objective.*

1. Standardized application structure and documentation
2. Necessary database updating/organizing complete
3. Data creation/flow complete and update schedule set
4. Integration of app into POC's current data tool collection.
5. Transition to advertising, testing, revision.

## Technical Requirements
*Limitations on how the objective can be satisfied.*

Must be completed with POC's current tech suite (R, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL)
and must be fit for integration with current tool collection and branding.

## Milestones
*Major steps in the process with soft/hard deadlines.*

* April 1: Stakeholder agreement on project scope (objective, goal, etc.).
* April 15: Mock-ups and tech strategy complete.
* April 30: Prototype implemented. Stakeholder review.

## Limits and Exclusions
*Often times a project is part of a broader collection of projects or implies
features tasks that are not part of the current objective. Here is where such
confusions can be clarified.*

This project does not include advertising or full-scale usability testing in
its scope. These will likely need to be tackled after the project given
available resources/personnel.
