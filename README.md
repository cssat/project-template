# POC Visualization Project Template

This is a starter template for visualization projects. It includes the basic style, module files and structure that we expect of new visualizations as well as instructions for how to write and include content.

## Get Started

1. Clone the repo.

2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/)

3. Fire up the terminal, cd to the project structure and then into the /assets folder. Type "npm install" to install the modules you'll need to manage Sass and JavaScript.

4. Type "gulp watch," hit Enter and away you go!
